The purpose of this handbook is to support implementers and ensure that their solutions correctly handle the e-ordering process used by Singapore government buyers. Peppol BIS Advanced Ordering is comprehensive and feature-rich, but in practice, trading partners often use only a subset of these features. This adaptation typically reflects specific business needs, contractual agreements, and established practices within a community, such as legal procurement requirements or industry-specific processes.

Peppol BIS states that the specification "can function as a component in an EDI agreement within a trading community." This handbook serves as such an agreement, defining which process steps and functionalities are used or not used in this context.
