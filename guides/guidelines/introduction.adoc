The purpose of this handbook is to support implementers Peppol BIS Advanced Ordering and ensure that their solutions correctly handle the process used by Singapore government buyers. The BIS is comprehensive and feature-rich, but in practice, trading partners often use only a subset of these features. This adaptation typically reflects specific business needs, contractual agreements, and established practices within a community, such as legal procurement requirements or industry-specific processes.

The BIS states that the specification "can function as a component in an EDI agreement within a trading community." This handbook serves as such an agreement, defining which process steps and functionalities are used or not used in this context.
